# Blazor Excel

Very basic implementation of an Excel style editable table.

Select a cell, enter content, set bold, italics, background colour, and text alignment.

Could expand to add resizing of columns, changing colour of text, changing fonts on a per-cell and default level.

Rather poor performance over say 100x100 cells. Mostly due to how Blazor renders content and tracks changes
